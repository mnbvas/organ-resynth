# organ-resynth
This attempts to "listen" to a wave file as if it was played by an organ, and synthesizes what it "heard".

It's just some code I wrote for my Music &amp; Mathematics course at university, so it's not really pretty, but I can't be bothered to rewrite it properly.

Runs on Python 2 (maybe 3, not expected) with NumPy

Run `python organ_resynth.py --help` for usage.
